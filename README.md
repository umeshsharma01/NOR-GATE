# NOR-GATE
A NOR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that performs the inverse operation of the OR gate.
It has two or more input signals and one output signal.
The output of the NOR gate becomes high (1) only when all input signals are low and for any other input combination the output becomes low (0).
The NOR operation is represented as the complement of the OR operation. 
The NOR gate is a universal gate which means that any digital logic circuit can be constructed using only NOR gates.
